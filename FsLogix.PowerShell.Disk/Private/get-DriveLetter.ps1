        .SYNOPSIS
        Obtains a VHD path and mounts the VHD to the next available
        drive Letter. Allows ability to search and use folders/items
        within a VHD. User will need to then dismount VHD on their
        own. 

        .DESCRIPTION
        This function can be added to any script that requires mounting 
        a vhd and accessing it's contents.

        .PARAMETER VHDPath
        The target path for VHD location.

        .EXAMPLE
        mount-FSLVHD -path \\server\share\ODFC\vhd1.vhdx
        Will return the drive letter
